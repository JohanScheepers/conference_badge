# conference_badge

This is a great starting point for a Flutter conference app! Here's a more detailed breakdown and some suggestions for implementation:

## Core Features:

### 1.	Attendee:

 _Badge:
  -Information: Name, Photo, Title, Company, Contact Details, QR Code (for scanning), Conference Pass (e.g., VIP, Speaker, etc.)
  -Customization: Ability to change the background color or add a personal touch.
  -Accessibility: Ensure the badge is accessible for users with visual impairments (e.g., using larger font sizes or alternative color schemes).

 _Schedule:
  -Listing: Display talks, workshops, demos, keynote sessions, and other activities.
  -Filtering: Allow attendees to filter by track, category, speaker, date, time, or keywords.

 _Map:
  -Indoor Navigation: Use a 2D map of the venue and integrate with BLE beacons (more on this below).
  -Location Tracking: Track the user's location within the venue and provide directions to specific points of interest (booths, sessions, restrooms, etc.), this will be handled by the app and not the back end.
  -Points of Interest (POIs): Mark booths, speaker rooms, food areas, networking events, and other relevant locations.
  -Search: Allow attendees to search for specific locations.
  -Accessibility: Ensure the map is usable for users with disabilities (e.g., colour contrast, alternative navigation methods).

 _Sponsors:
  -Listing: Display sponsors with their logos, descriptions, websites, and contact details.
  -Interactive Map Integration: Show sponsor booths on the map.
  -Social Media Integration: Allow attendees to follow sponsors on social media.

 _News Feed:
  -Announcements: Display important announcements and updates from organizers.

 _Chat/Messaging:
  -Allow attendees to communicate with each other and organizers within the app.
  -Group Chat: Facilitate discussions based on interests or specific sessions.

 _Networking:

  -Networking Events: List and provide details of networking events.
  -Matchmaking: Use algorithms to suggest attendees with similar interests.

 _Feedback:

### 3.	Organizers:

 _Slide Decks: Allow users to access and download presentation slides.
 _Past Schedules: Provide access to archives of past conference schedules.
 _Speaker Bios: Showcase past speaker profiles.


## Technical Considerations:

 _Flutter: This project will Flutter for cross-platform development (Android and iOS).

 _Backend: We are consider using a backend service like Serverpod, Firebase, or even a custom server to manage data, authentication, push notifications, and other functionality.

 _State Management: Riverpod

 _BLE Beacon Integration:
  -SDKs: Use Flutter packages that interact with BLE beacons (e.g., flutter_blue).
  -Beacon Placement: Carefully plan the placement of beacons for optimal indoor navigation coverage.

 _Maps:
  -Google Maps OpenStreetMap or Custom Maps: Use a mapping service for outdoor and indoor map rendering.
  -Offline Maps: Enabling offline map support for better user experience in areas with poor connectivity.

 _Accessibility: Follow Flutter's accessibility guidelines to ensure the app is usable for everyone.

 _Security: Secure user data and protect against potential vulnerabilities.

## Additional Features:

 _Gamification: Incorporate features that encourage attendee engagement ~~(e.g., point systems, badges, leader boards).
 _Social Media Sharing: Allow attendees to share their experiences on social media.
 _Translation: Support multiple languages for international conferences.

## Monetization:

 _Sponsor Ads: Display ads from sponsors within the app.
